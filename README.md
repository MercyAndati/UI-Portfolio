This project is a clean and modern personal portfolio website designed for showcasing skills, experience, and services as a UI Designer and Web Developer. It features a responsive layout with a professional hero section, biography area, and service offerings. Built using pure HTML and CSS, the site highlights sections like "About Me," "Services," and a call-to-action to hire. The design is perfect for freelancers, designers, and developers who want a minimal and stylish online presence.
